## Description

Travelogue provides a user-friendly experience to quickly create a log of all your trips, including the destination, dates, and any notes you want to remember. The application is easy to use. Simply sign in and begin logging your travels. 

From the landing page, you can click the login button and be directed to the login screen. If you do not already have an account, you are offered the option to register with a user name, email, and password.

Once you are logged in, you will be presented with a page where you can enter in the dates, destination, and any travel notes you may have about your trip. Then hit the submit button and your information will be saved as a travelogue and the entry fields will clear so that you can enter another trip.

The log is added to a list of previous entries.

## Concept

- ### User Story

      AS a user,
      I WANT to be able to write and save notes about my travels
      SO THAT i can keep track and view the dates, destinations, and thoughts about my trips.


- ### Acceptance Criteria

        GIVEN a travelogue application:
        WHEN I log into the website using a unique username and password
        THEN I am presented with a form to enter a new trip.
        AFTER I enter a new log with dates, destination, and notes, I click a submit button.
        THEN the new log is saved and appears on the home page, along with previous entries.
        IF I click on the dashboard, I can enter a new log.

      
      
- ### Motivation/Development

          Going on any trip can be a memorable experience. Whether it is one trip or many travels, this website provides a way to remember those experiences by providing a logue of the dates, destinations, and any memories you want to record in the notes, forever peserving all your travels in one place, and allowing you to read them time and time again.
  
            Our collaborative project has brought us to solve a problem that a lot of people may have. So everytime you take a trip, rememeber to login, create a new logue, or revisit your previous trips and remember your travels forever.
